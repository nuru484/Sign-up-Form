## Overview

### The challenge

The project:

- Should have a large background image.
- Should incorporate an image or logo in the sidebar section.
- Apply a dark, semi-transparent background to enhance text readability.
- Create Account Button: There should be a "Create Account" button with a color similar to tones found in the background image
- Responsive Design: While the primary focus is on desktop resolutions, the layout remains functional and visually appealing at different screen sizes.
- Validation (optional): There should be a JavaScript validation to check if password fields match or validate each field separately.

### Features

- Responsive on both desktop and mobiles.
- User friendly interface.
- Password validation to ensure it's strong and also matches the confirm password.

### What I learned

- Learnt a bit of responsive design and how to make sites responsive with little or no media queries at all.
- Learnt how to manipulate flexbox for responsive design.
- I also learnt some advanced CSS selectors and HTML forms and how to create forms to ensure site security.
- Learnt how to validate user inputs using HTML and also JavaScript.

### Continued development

- To show a new interface after the form data has been submitted.
- All though it looks nice when viewed on mobile devices, it doesn't fit that much and I'm working to ensure that.
- Style the alerts for the validations.
- And any other feature worth adding

### Useful resources
